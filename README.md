# 3d-muscle-segmentation

This repository accompanies our paper: Automated MRI quantification of volumetric per muscle fat-fractions in the proximal leg of patients with muscular distrophies. It provides the best performing LI and HI models accopanied with code to obtain a segmentation on a control case and an early-, intermediate- and end-stage patient. 
We have made use of the DeepVoxNet2 (DVN2) framework.
